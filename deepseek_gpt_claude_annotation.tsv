2020_MLa_118_2.docx	Thesis	As for me, I suppose that watching sports via TV won't help you become a professional at sport.	H	H	H	H	H	H	H	H	H
2020_MLa_118_2.docx	Thesis	Moreover, sport events are not very interesting to be seen through television channels.	H	H	H	H	H	H	H	H	H
2020_MLa_118_2.docx	Argument	people say that you can learn a lot from sport programmes.	L	H	H	L	L	L	L	L	H

2020_MLa_118_2.docx	Elaboration	The first reason is that fascinating feelings are provided at the same time you see the players who are not far from you.	H	L	H	H	H	H	H	L	H

2020_MLa_119_2_.docx	Elaboration	And even better, when you all are rooting for one favorite team or sportsman or woman, it makes you very close.	H	L	H	H	H	H	H	L	H
2020_MLa_119_2_.docx	Conclusion	So we concluse that watching sports doesn't have negative things, but only provides many benefits.	H	L	H	H	L	L	H	L	H

2020_MLa_123_2_.docx	Elaboration	It could be caused by several reasons.	L	H	L	L	H	L	L	H	L
2020_MLa_123_2_.docx	Elaboration	For example, a lot of people see their future connected with sports, they are inspired by it and have aim to look and be like their idol.	L	L	H	L	L	L	L	L	L

2020_MLa_123_2_.docx	Argument	Also such events help people to find friends.	L	H	L	L	H	L	L	H	L
2020_MLa_123_2_.docx	Argument	On the other hand we can save our money on tickets, time on riding to the stadium from home and spend time in more relaxed atmosphere and so on.	L	L	L	L	L	L	L	L	L
2020_MLa_123_2_.docx	Elaboration	This way can teach people something new because when you do not disturbed by other emotions, people and when you can see the whole situation on TV, you see more than people on a large stadium.	L	L	H	H	L	H	L	L	L
2020_MLa_123_2_.docx	Elaboration	It is very useful for analysing the game and strategy of teams.	L	H	H	L	H	H	L	H	H

2020_MLa_123_2_.docx	Argument	And the last reason that I will notice is that nowadays during coronavirus pandemic, it is very scary and dangerous to visit such overcrowded events.	L	L	H	L	L	L	L	L	L
2020_MLa_123_2_.docx	Conclusion	In concluslusion, people should spend their time as they want.	L	L	L	L	L	L	L	L	L
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Introductory	Sport has always been not only a mean of keeping yourself fit and being active, it is also an entertainment that attracts a lot of people, who watch different sport events on television or visit them themselves.	H	L	H	H	L	H	H	L	H
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Thesis	However there is a belief that such time spending is useless.	H	L	H	L	L	H	H	L	H
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Thesis	I do not agree with such statement.	H	H	H	L	L	H	H	H	H
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Argument	There are a lot of people who are keen on sport but can not take part in such activities for various reasons, like health or lack of facilities in the area.	H	H	L	H	H	L	H	H	L
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Elaboration	For such people, it is the only way of feeling the same excitement as if they were playing or participating in some game themselves.	H	H	H	H	H	H	H	H	H
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Elaboration	They also can transfer their intrest in a slightly different area of involvement.	H	L	H	H	L	L	H	L	H
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Elaboration	Spectators are very likely to gain intrest in learning different moves, some techniques and at some point this can become their proffesional interest.	H	L	H	H	L	H	H	L	H
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Elaboration	There is a fact which shows that most of successful referees and commentators were huge fans of sport, so the opportunity to watch sport can become something professional and even provide an income.	H	H	H	H	H	H	H	L	H
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Argument	It is undoubtable that an enourmous amount of people watch sport, and keeping up with majority's interest can help people to sociolize and feel not excluded from the group.	H	L	H	H	L	H	H	L	H
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Elaboration	Such sense of belonging is vital for human beings and it is evident that creating communities, like a sporting one, can provide this.	H	H	H	H	H	H	H	H	H
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Elaboration	For example, everybody knows various football clubs exist, and their members are united by the same ideas and the same interest and most of their free time is spended together, usually by watching matches on TV in pubs or community house if there is one.	H	L	H	H	L	H	H	L	H
2020_MLa_124_2.docx	Elaboration	People enter these club because of the welcoming atmosphere there and acception by co-members, and developing mutual affection for sport will only strengthens thier bonds and minimise the feeling of lonelyness.	H	L	H	H	L	H	H	L	H
